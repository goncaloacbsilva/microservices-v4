✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Requirements
To run this example you'll need following:
- Docker
- A local Kubernetes cluster running (Minikube for example)
- [Istio](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/getting-started/)
- [Tilt](https://docs.tilt.dev)

## Setup
In the root directory execute
```bash
yarn install
istioctl install — set profile=demo -y # Install Istio into the cluster with the demo configuration profile
kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled # Enable Envoy sidecar proxies
```

## Run
You can deploy/manage all the resources with tilt
```
tilt up
```

To delete all the resources created use:
```
tilt down
```

The aim of this repository is to provide a base project for the development of microservices with NestJS

## Understand this workspace

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of the projects.

## Remote caching

Run `npx nx connect-to-nx-cloud` to enable [remote caching](https://nx.app) and make CI faster.
